                                I can’t pinpoint exactly when my battle with mental illness began, but I do know that by
                                the
                                time I was a teenager, it was in full swing.

                                I can also say that when I was fourteen, I started to question if I wanted to be alive
                                anymore.

                                Though I haven’t been a teenager in some time, I can still remember what it felt like to
                                be that
                                young and to be struggling with mental illness. It was the most difficult thing I’ve
                                ever gone
                                through.
                                I want you to know that I believe you. Your pain is real, and no amount of denial from
                                anybody
                                else can change the fact that it’s really there.

                                Whether it is anxiety, depression, numbness, mood swings, whatever your struggle may be
                                – I
                                believe that it’s real, that it affects you, and that you aren’t making this up.

                                After one too many nights of self-harm, depression, and hopelessness, I decided to go to
                                a
                                teacher at school. She took me to a crisis counselor, who helped me find a therapist and
                                other
                                resources. The great thing about the crisis counselor was that she wasn’t required to
                                call my
                                parents, so I was able to talk to my parents in my own way, when I was truly ready.

                                Getting help was the best decision I ever made, though it didn’t feel like it at the
                                time. I
                                felt like I’d squeezed all the toothpaste out of the tube, and I’d never be able to put
                                it back
                                inside again. At least with my depression, I knew what to expect. It was predictable.
                                But now I
                                was going to have to learn to live my life another way. I was going to have to learn how
                                to cope
                                and get better. This was a big deal and it was scary.

                                But you know what? It was also worth it. Because eventually, I did start to get better.
                                I also
                                got a diagnosis – obsessive-compulsive disorder and complex PTSD – which helped me
                                understand
                                exactly what was going on. With a therapist and psychiatrist in my corner, and
                                eventually family
                                and friends, I was able to start putting the pieces of my life back together.

                                If I could say anything to teenagers with a mental health struggle, it’s that you don’t
                                have to
                                do this alone. You don’t have to suffer in silence. You have choices, even if it feels
                                like
                                those choices are too difficult, too scary, or too risky.

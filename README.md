# SnapBack

This repo contains a solution to Junction 2022 challenge Keep calm and don't panic.
The name is SnapBack.

During the journey of becoming an adult, the youth might face some problems like sleep disorder, game addiction, etc. The young people may not be able to solve those problems themselves and could not figure out the method of requiring help. Their parents or friends might not be that professional in helping them. With new technologies developing, digital along with traditional solutions could better assist in creating a platform where all the important information, functionalities, and support could be found.

Our group plans to design a website. Young people could get their support. Parents could get guidance on helping their kids. Volunteers could gain information on lending a helping hand. Partners and donors could also get access to realize their value.

## How the project was developed.
In the beginning we used WordPress because it can produce a project with high degree of completion in a short time.
When combining WordPress with Tidio plugin, we have quite a feasible solution for the idea just in one night.
But then we realise having a high degree of completion to the project doesn't mean the project is creative. Binding to WordPress framework actually limits the creativity because we think more about how to fit the idea into the framework, instead of vice versa.
So, we use as minimum framework as possible.

The following are the features we have in the project. We would design an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -powered Chatbot. This chatbot could simplify the customer’s journey and also improve the volunteers' and professional efficiency. It could also reduce the inequalities. AI could also facilitate mental health screening and assessment. Besides that, matching services could also be strengthened with AI.

Furthermore, a community could be built up. All of the youth who have got some comfort from the Finnish Red Cross’s Youth Shelters could volunteer to share their own story anonymously. In this way, the youth could believe in and rely on the organization more and more. Such a community could be the youth’s strong backup. They would know that they are not alone. Encouragements and promotions would be around the community.

Booths attached with mailboxes are one of our main activities. All of our customers could find the map and the timeline of our moving booths. It could only accommodate one person per time slot. The well-decorated booths could let everyone feel relaxed. Anyone could get in whenever she/he feels depressed or confused after scheduling through our website. From the outside, we could only see whether the booth was available or not. There would be a telephone in each booth, the customer could get their answers through the telephones. The volunteers and professionals would be 7/24 there to provide help. Everyone could also drop their letter at the mailbox. There are some stickers with codes. Attach the sticker to the envelope and after one week the person could get some suggestions through tapping the code on our webpage/app.
